The game is set in a near distant future where technology is slightly more advance but social contstructa remain relatively unchanged.
In the Centro Linea universe there are 3 plateaus of reality, each existing in a seperate place in space and time.
The earth and our current universe is the second and center plateau, with one above and below. 
Each plateau are aware of the one below, however are unable to empathise with them and can only speculate on the one above. Reality in this way is best describe as a series one one way windows.
Nature is the plateau below ours 'linea bassa' and heaven/idea omnipicence is the plateau above 'sola linea'
The the natator of the story will be from 'linea superiore' and the naming conventions of the story will be based on this,the real world language is corsican)

those from linea bassa are called nundian
and those from sola linea are called soluean
